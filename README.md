## Event Manager

This parses CSV files. http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html

## Hangman

Command line hangman with saving and loading functionality. User guesses a word randomly chosen from a dictionary file. After every turn, user is prompted to save or continue playing. Saving leaves the game and dumps the Hangman instance into YAML. Beginning every game of hangman, the user is prompted if he would like to start from a saved file or continue anew.
